## Overview

Welcome to Scott Murff's Full-Stack Product Builder workshop.

In this workshop, we explore the hypothesis that: with the help of AI tools a new professional archetype is arising, that of *full-stack product builder*. 

A full-stack product builder is someone who is able to play well across the entire digital product lifecycle of:

1) Strategy: figure out what to build, why, and for whom
2) Design & Engineering: actually build, scale, and maintain the product
3) Go-to-Market & Growth: Launch and distribute the product
4) Data Science: Analyze product performance and make data driven bets for the next round of strategic choices.

Historically, especially in large organizations, no one person was competent at all of these things.

We are now living in a world where high agency, curious, and ambitous individuals can learn to do all of these things relatively well. Not to say it's easy, but it's now possible whereas in the past it was actually impossible.

The role of a Product Manager has always been demanding. Often labeled the "CEO of Product," the skillset required of a product manager are broad and typically include:

- Strategic thinking – setting vision, making trade-offs, and aligning with business goals
- Customer insight – understanding user needs and pain points
- Analytical ability – using data and critical thinking to guide decisions
- Technical & design fluency – collaborating effectively with engineers and designers
- Execution & organization – planning roadmaps, prioritizing, and delivering results
- Communication & leadership – influencing, storytelling, and managing stakeholders

The day-to-day responsibilities of different product managers can vary widely due to differences in organizational size. In smaller companies and startups, product managers may function as full-stack PMs, taking on a broad set of responsibilities that can include customer research, defining product strategy, writing requirements and even code, creating prototypes, tracking metrics, and handling marketing or sales support.

By contrast, in larger organizations, roles tend to become much more specialized. Activities such as user research, data analysis, product design, or technical specification may be owned by separate functions (e.g. data scientists, designers, or technical product managers) allowing a PM to focus more narrowly on business strategy while still collaborating closely with specialized colleagues.

This reality helps explain the ongoing debate about whether technical skills are important for product managers to have. In some companies, strong technical expertise is absolutely essential, while in others a PM can succeed without deep technical knowledge.

For our purposes we take the perspective that a PM must have relatively deep techincal knowledge to orchestrate AI in powerful ways. Fortunately, AI itself has dramatically accelerated how quickly one can learn technical skills. What used to take months can now be learned in days with focused effort.

The focus of todays workshop will be on engineering and design skills.

If our hypothesis is correct we should see a convergence of skills into a single profile. That convergence can come from any direction. Today, our focus is on PMs developing engineering and design skills to become full-stack product builders.

The workshop is designed for technically inclined PMs and adjacent roles with some prior coding experience recommended, although not required. 

You'll learn to:

- Use Claude Code for rapid product development using spec-driven development principles (must sign up for your own $20/month subscription)
- Build and connect a full-stack app with a Supabase backend (Postgres relational database)
- Deploy your app live on Vercel, with GitHub for version control
